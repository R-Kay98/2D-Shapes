Below are the assumptions made for this 2D-shape base system:

1) A point being on the border or very close to the border of the rectangle will count as being inside.
2) All 2D-shapes are closed and fall into the category of either a Polygon or an Ellipse.
3) There are no intermediary classes or classifications between the Polygon and the end-shapes (e.g: rectangle).
4) Since a single source code file was specified, there are no additional files to separate the classes
   into header files and class files for the purpose of readability.
5) The base system will be based on coordinates in order to accurately specify where an object is in relation
   to another.
6) No base function implementation to determine whether a point is inside or outside the rectangle needs to be
   generalized to the polygon class.
7) We are allowed to use the C++ standard libraries.
